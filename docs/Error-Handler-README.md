#### Error-Handler - Configuration File

> [!INFO] Overview
> 
> The **error_handler.py** file is a key component of the ChatRagi application that ensures a consistent and secure way to handle unexpected errors. Its main functions are to record error details for technical review and to provide a simple error message to the user when something goes wrong.

> [!question] How it Works?
> 
> 1. **Logging the Error:**
> 	When an error occurs, the error handler captures the exception details, including a traceback, and writes this information to a log file. This helps the technical team diagnose and resolve issues without exposing sensitive information to users.
> 2. **Returning a Standardized Response:**
> 	Instead of displaying complex error details to the user, the error handler sends back a standardized JSON response that indicates an internal server error. This maintains a professional and consistent user experience.
> 3. **Centralized Exception Handling:**
> 	By centralizing error handling in one module, the application can uniformly manage errors across all its Flask routes. This makes the application more robust and easier to maintain.
