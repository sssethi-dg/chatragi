# Chatbot

#### Overview
The **chatbot.py** application is designed to help users interact with a large collection of documents using natural language queries. The system indexes documents using advanced machine learning techniques, allowing the chatbot to retrieve relevant passages and provide informed responses.

#### How it Works?
1. **Index Initialization:**
	When the application starts, it retrieves the document collection from a database (ChromaDB). If a previously built index exists, the system loads it; otherwise, it builds a new vector index from the documents. This index allows the chatbot to search for and retrieve relevant information efficiently.
2. **Query Processing:**
	When a user submits a query, the chatbot processes the query using a query engine that searches the index. The system then returns the most relevant answer based on similarity parameters. At the same time, the conversation (user query and chatbot response) is stored as memory.
3. **Memory Storage:**
	Each conversation is stored in a dedicated memory database. This memory helps the chatbot recall previous interactions, allowing for more context-aware responses in future queries.
4. **Logging and Exception Handling:**
	The application includes robust logging and exception handling to help developers diagnose issues quickly and ensure that the system remains stable even if errors occur.

#### Benefits
- **Efficient Document Retrieval:**
	The vector index enables fast and precise retrieval of relevant document passages, making the chatbot responsive and useful for various queries.
- **Context-Aware Responses:**
	By storing past interactions as memory, the chatbot can consider previous conversations to provide better answers over time.
- **Reliability:**
	Built-in logging and error handling help maintain the systemâ€™s stability and provide clear diagnostics for troubleshooting.
